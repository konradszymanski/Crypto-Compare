### Crypto-Compare
## CoinGecko Crypto Data API Project
# Details
The project is made from scratch in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.  Crypto-Compare is fetching data from CoinGeko Cryptocurrency API, where the results are depends on you (user)
# Idea
 All of the Cryptocurrency websites are having a horizotal tables, with listed e.g. 50 coins in bulk.  I was thinking that would be a nice idea to pick only the coins you want to check, and list them in a vertical table.  That would be easier to scroll down on mobile devices as well.
